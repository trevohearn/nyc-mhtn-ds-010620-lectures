This time however, you are free to analyze any of the survey questions that you find interesting. Below is a list of statistical operations that you must perform for this lab. Each one must be accompanied by a graphic and at least one sentence explaining what you learned from the statistic or the test.  

You must complete the following types statistical operations:
- Create a confidence interval for a sample mean.
- Create a confidence interval for a sample proportion.
- Perform a two-sample test of means.
- Perform a two sample test of proportions.

- Perform a one-way ANOVA

To reiterate, you will to look at 'PHYSHLTH' or the 'CHRONIC' columns that you previously worked with. You can look at any of the items within this survey.  When choosing which survey questions to analyze have a hypothesis about the question before your performing a test. Also be sure to properly clean your the responses. Finally, try to develop a consistent theme between the survey items you investigate. I.E., the survey item that you create a mean confidence interval for, should be involved in your ANOVA.
